You got some dates? I got some monitoring and notifications!

# What is this?
This is mostly a challenge for myself. In retail grocery settings, capturing close-dated product is a cruicial
shrink control. Product goes out of date and we didn't catch it? Total loss. We are notified of items approaching
their end-of-life? We can reduce these items in an attempt to get partial credit instead of nothing at all. 

# Why does this tool need to exist?
Currently (at least at my company), date checking and rotation is done completely manually with zero tracking
of items. This tool is designed to help track expiration dates of product and ensure all product is captured before its
end-of-life.
